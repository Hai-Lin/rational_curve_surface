// degree 3 (in u) x degree 2 (in v)

// two knot vectors, the first in U, the second in V
0. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.
0. 0. 1. 1.

// and here are the control points array: 3 rows of 4 xyz points each.
// 3 rows because it’s a simple quadratic in V, 4 columns of xyz vals because
// it’s a simple cubic in U. Note also that: num_knots - degree + 1
// holds for both U and V
